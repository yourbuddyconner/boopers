# Boopers: Boop your Friends

## Overview

Boops are an innovative engagement tracking system that uses NFC technology to gamify and measure interaction within physical spaces. 

## What is a Booper?

A Booper is a physical NFC tag that can be placed in various locations. When a user interacts with (or "boops") a Booper using their NFC-enabled smartphone, the interaction is recorded in our system.

## Lifecycle of a Booper

1. **Creation**
   - An event space owner registers a new Booper in the system.
   - They assign it a unique name and description.
   - Optionally, they can associate point values or specific actions with the Booper.

2. **Deployment**
   - The physical NFC tag is placed in a strategic location within the event space.
   - This could be near exhibits, at entry/exit points, or hidden in interesting locations.

3. **Activation**
   - The Booper becomes active and ready to record interactions.

4. **Interaction (Boops)**
   - Patrons discover and interact with the Booper using their smartphones.
   - Each interaction is recorded as a "Boop" in the system.

5. **Data Collection**
   - The system collects data on each Boop, including:
     - Timestamp
     - User ID (if the user is registered)
     - Location data (if available)

6. **Analysis**
   - The event space owner can view analytics on Booper interactions.
   - This includes data like total Boops, unique users, peak interaction times, etc.

7. **Maintenance/Updates**
   - Boopers can be updated with new information or point values.
   - They can be temporarily deactivated or permanently retired.

8. **Retirement**
   - When no longer needed, a Booper can be retired from the system.
   - Historical data is retained for analysis.

## Lifecycle of a Boop

1. **Initiation**
   - A user discovers a Booper and brings their smartphone close to it.

2. **Registration**
   - The NFC interaction is detected and sent to the Boopers system.
   - A new Boop is created in the database.

3. **Processing**
   - The system records the Boop details (time, location, user if known).
   - Any associated actions are triggered (e.g., awarding points, unlocking content).

4. **Confirmation**
   - The user receives immediate feedback on their device, confirming the Boop.
   - They may see points awarded, a fun message, or unlocked content.

5. **Analytics**
   - The Boop data is immediately available for real-time analytics.

## Use Case: Event Space Engagement Tracking

For an event space owner looking to track engagement:

1. **Setup**
   - Register multiple Boopers in the system.
   - Assign point values to each Booper based on its location or significance.
   - Hide Boopers throughout the event space.

2. **Patron Engagement**
   - Encourage patrons to download the Boopers app or use a web interface.
   - Patrons explore the space, discovering and interacting with Boopers.
   - Each Boop earns them points and potentially unlocks special content about exhibits or offers.

3. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - The event space owner can monitor engagement in real-time.
   - They can see which areas are most popular and at what times.

4. **Gamification**
   - Implement a leaderboard to encourage competition among patrons.
   - Offer rewards for patrons who reach certain point thresholds or find all Boopers.

5. **Post-Event Analysis**
   - After the event, analyze the data to understand patron behavior.
   - Use insights to improve future events, layouts, or marketing strategies.

6. **Long-term Benefits**
   - Build a database of patron interactions over time.
   - Use data to personalize experiences for returning visitors.

By leveraging the Boopers system, event space owners can transform passive spaces into interactive, engaging environments that encourage exploration and provide valuable insights into patron behavior.
